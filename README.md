# Array and String Practice (C)

This directory contains practice programs focused on **arrays** and **strings** in the C programming language.  
The goal is to build strong fundamentals through small, logic-oriented programs.

---

## Topics Covered

### Arrays
- One-dimensional arrays
- Input and output of arrays
- Traversing arrays using loops
- Searching elements (linear search)
- Basic array operations (sum, max, min, count)
- Passing arrays to functions

### Strings
- Character arrays
- String input/output
- Common string operations (length, copy, compare)
- Manual implementation of string logic
- Use of standard library functions (`<string.h>`)

## Folder Structure

Each file focuses on **one problem + one concept**.

**Naming convention:**


problemName_concept.c

```

**Examples:**
```

sum_array.c
reverse_array.c
count_vowels_string.c
string_length_manual.c

````

---

## How to Run

Compile using `gcc`:

```bash
gcc file_name.c -o output
./output
````

## Notes

* Written in ANSI C
* Logic-first approach (no shortcuts unless required)
* Suitable for beginners and exam preparation

---

## Purpose

* Strengthen problem-solving skills
* Prepare for DSA and core programming exams
* Build reusable logic patterns
